A complete Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm
User-friendly interface with board visualization
Input validation and error handling
Win/tie detection
Intelligent AI moves that:

Look ahead to future game states
Try to win when possible
Block the player from winning
Make strategic moves to maximize winning chances



The AI uses the minimax algorithm, which:

Recursively evaluates all possible future moves
Assumes both players play optimally
Assigns scores to game states (+1 for AI win, -1 for human win, 0 for tie)
Chooses the move that leads to the best possible outcome
